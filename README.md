# Knowledge & Data - Vrije Universiteit

Tutorials and Assignments for the Knowledge &amp; Data course @ Vrije Universiteit.

Based on the work of [Rinke Hoekstra](https://github.com/RinkeHoekstra) and [Klaas de Graaf](https://github.com/kadevgraaf) in the [previous repository](https://github.com/RinkeHoekstra/semanticweb-web-application-tutorial).


### Objectives

The objective of the Knowledge and Data course is to make students acquainted with methods and technologies used for expressing knowledge and data, in particular published on the Web. At the end of this course, you will have built an intelligent Web application that queries and reasons over knowledge integrated from various sources obtained from the Web. All this will be based on formal logical theory.

In this course you will study formalisms that are useful and necessary to represent knowledge and data, in particular when this knowledge and data is to be reused, e.g. published on the web. We introduce the Semantic Web stack, a set of technologies and representation formats (RDF, RDFS, OWL) for expressing semantics and linked data in a web-accessible format, use the SPARQL query language to query over this data, and build a Web application that uses the data for some intelligent task.

### Support
